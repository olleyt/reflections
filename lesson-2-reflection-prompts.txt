What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- an empty repository was created so that I can start adding files to it manually instead of commiting entire folder contents of the current folder
- it is possible to see untracked files that can be added to the repository by using git status command

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

change?
