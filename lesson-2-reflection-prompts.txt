What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- an empty repository was created so that I can start adding files to it manually instead of commiting entire folder contents of the current folder
- it is possible to see untracked files that can be added to the repository by using git status command

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
- staging area is area that allows to prepare a logical change and bundle up a set of required files for a commit
- working directory contains all tracked and untracked files by the repository

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

- I can add only files that were modified per one logical change in the staging area
- then use git commit for commiting the change

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
- Branches can help when working on experimental features, client customizaton, anothe langauge version
- labels help keep branches organised as keeping the purpose of each branch clear
- context switching
- bug fixing in a specific branch
- they allow to collaborate publicly 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
- diagrams show which changes are related to which branch
- I can safely check out my team member branch and test it before merging it to master

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
